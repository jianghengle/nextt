The NEXTT pilot testbed is a novel, Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN)-based experimental wireless network. The testbed contains three major components: Software Defined Distribution Units (SD-DU) (a.k.a Cognitive Remote Radio Heads), fiber Ethernet-based fronthaul network, and cloud-based baseband processing and data storage. Currently, there are 5 SD-DUs deployed at 4 buildings on UNL campus and 1 street light in Lincoln city. Via Fiber Ethernet-based fronthaul network, these SD-DUs are connected to Holland Computing Center (HCC), where baseband processing and data storage are taken place. The core of SD-DU is a high-end 4x4 MIMO Software Defined Radio (SDR) Transceiver, Ettus N310, which can be tuned to any sub-6GHz frequency. The NEXTT pilot testbed allows researchers to access its radio sites and computing resources remotely.
